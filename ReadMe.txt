We calculate time-domain THz-OA signal intensities of NaCl solutions with different concentration (0.5, 0.75, 1, 1.5, 2, 3 mol/L) based on the following equation:

P_0=(\dfrac{\beta V_S^2}{C_p})\eta_{th}\int_{0.2THz}^{1.5THz}\mu_a (\upsilon) F_{\upsilon}(\upsilon)d\upsilon

​The relationship between \beta and NaCl solution concentration is from Ref [1].

The relationship between V_s and NaCl solution concentration is from Ref [2].

The relationship between C_p and NaCl solution concentration is from Ref [3].

We ignore the change of \eta_{th}, and consider it as 1, according to Ref [4].

The relationship between \mu_a(\upsilon) and NaCl solution concentration is from Ref [5].

The expression of F_{\upsilon}(\upsilon) is fitted by the spectrum of terahertz pulse.
